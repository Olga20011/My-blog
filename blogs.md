# Resources for web developer
Web development involves developing websites and web pages. Web development ranges from developing simple single static page of plain text to complex applications, electronic businesses and social network services. Inorder to enhance productivity when developing websites, many tools are required to make the task light weight.
The tools are listed below as follows.

### 1. Coding tools
Coding tools are computer programs that software developers use to create, debug, maintain or otherwise support other programs and applications.
They ranges from the coding languages to the text editors used when writing code.  
The coding languages include;  
- Javacsript 
- Python
- Kotlin 
- Html and Css 
- C++ 
- Ruby on rails,etc  

While the coding languages aim at writing code, the text editors provide a platform where the code is written.  
Below are the some of the most commonly used text editors.  
- Visual studio
- Pycharm
- Atom
- Sublim text

### 2. Frameworks
The frameworks have conventions for how the code is written and structured, which standardize how the developers write their code.  
The aim of frameworks is to provide a common structure so that developers don’t have to redo it from scratch and can reuse the code provided. In this way, frameworks allow us to cut out much of the work and save a lot of time.However ,frameworks are categorised into two ie backend frameworks and frontend frameworks.  
#### a. Backend Frameworks  
The backend consists of the server, the database, and the code that interacts with them. This also consists of the code that gives dynamic data to the frontend of the site.  
Backend frameworks are a lot more varied. They are written in a variety of programming languages and have a wide variety of features. Below, like the above list, is a list of some of the frameworks out there for writing application backends.  
- Spring MVC
- Django
- Flask
- Ruby on Rails
- Meteor
- Express

#### b. Frontend Frameworks  
The frontend of a web application is the part you see and interact with. It consists of the web design and the interaction of the site. In terms of programming languages, this is almost always comprised of the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript of the page.  
Frontend frameworks are, in most cases, written in JavaScript and are for organizing the functionality, interactivity of your website. Some of these include;
- Vue
- Angular JS
- Angular 2+
- React
- Ember

### 4. Colour tools
Colour tools help web designers with one of the most important choices we'll make in creating a site: colour selections. The colours we choose can have a psychological impact on those who view them so it's important we get it right.

For example, red is generally viewed as a high-energy colour, while blue implies calmness and peace. To illustrate this point, consider the colours you might use on a website selling children's toys versus a site for a law firm. Chances are, you'll go with bright, vibrant colours for the former, and muted tones of blue and grey for the latter.

But how do you know which colours work well together? Luckily, you don't have to be a master at colour theory to put together a workable palette. To help with the important task of colour selection, here are 14 of the best colour web design tools – and they're all free.

### 6. CSS Tools  
CSS is a computer language that defines web page styles, describing the look and formatting (presentation) in a markup language such as XML or HTML. This language features coding elements and is made up of "cascading style sheets" called CSS files (css). CSS is generally used in conjunction with HTML to change the styles of web pages and user interfaces.  
Today the tooling around CSS has evolved to a level that the workflow can not just be tamed but made enjoyable as well. In this article, I’m going to talk about five such CSS tools. I’ve consciously avoided, including “toy” tools like CSS generators, menu generators, etc., because they create more problems than they solve.  
- PostCSS
- PurgeCSS
- Tailwind
- Sass
- CSS Linters  

### 7. Icon tools  
A website icon is a picture or a symbol that you can put on your website. It acts like a button or a link that you click on, or it can simply be decorative.  
Wesite icons are important because of the following reasons.  
- Icons can be part of your business brand.  
- Icons make your site easier to navigate.  
- Icons help your overall website design.  
- Icons can be universally understood.
