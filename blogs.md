# Resources for web developer
Web development involves developing websites and web pages. Web development ranges from developing simple single static page of plain text to complex applications, electronic businesses and social network services. Inorder to enhance productivity when developing websites, many tools are required to make the task light weight.
The tools are listed below as follows.

### 1. Coding tools

### 3. Colour tools
Colour tools help web designers with one of the most important choices we'll make in creating a site: colour selections. The colours we choose can have a psychological impact on those who view them so it's important we get it right.

For example, red is generally viewed as a high-energy colour, while blue implies calmness and peace. To illustrate this point, consider the colours you might use on a website selling children's toys versus a site for a law firm. Chances are, you'll go with bright, vibrant colours for the former, and muted tones of blue and grey for the latter.

But how do you know which colours work well together? Luckily, you don't have to be a master at colour theory to put together a workable palette. To help with the important task of colour selection, here are 14 of the best colour web design tools – and they're all free.

### 5. CSS Tools  
CSS is a computer language that defines web page styles, describing the look and formatting (presentation) in a markup language such as XML or HTML. This language features coding elements and is made up of "cascading style sheets" called CSS files (css). CSS is generally used in conjunction with HTML to change the styles of web pages and user interfaces.  
Today the tooling around CSS has evolved to a level that the workflow can not just be tamed but made enjoyable as well. In this article, I’m going to talk about five such CSS tools. I’ve consciously avoided, including “toy” tools like CSS generators, menu generators, etc., because they create more problems than they solve.  
- PostCSS
- PurgeCSS
- Tailwind
- Sass
- CSS Linters  

### 6. Icon tools

Wesite icons are important because of the following reasons.  
- Icons can be part of your business brand.
